YOLO MODEL DIRECTORY (INTENTIONAL DESIGN)

This folder is currently empty.

In this project, YOLOv8 is used as a pretrained object detection model
for inference purposes only. The YOLOv8 pretrained weights (yolov8n.pt)
are automatically downloaded and managed internally by the Ultralytics
library during runtime.

Since the model is not fine-tuned or trained within this project,
the pretrained weights are not manually stored here to avoid
unnecessary duplication and to keep the project structure clean.

This directory is reserved for future use, such as:
- Fine-tuned YOLO models
- Custom-trained detection weights
- Versioned models for deployment
